<h2>About the Berkshire Writing Workshop</h2>
<p>Located on the bucolic campus of Bard College at Simon&rsquo;s Rock in Great Barrington, the BWW features week-long intensive workshops with a focus on the creation of new work.

<p>The Berkshire Writing Workshop completed its inaugural session in July 2012. If you would like to be notified when the 2013 summer schedule is available, please send an email to <a href="mailto:bww@simons-rock.edu">bww@simons-rock.edu</a>.</p>

<h1>BELOW IS WHAT WAS THERE PREVIOUSLY</h1>

<p>The 2012 Berkshire Writing Workshop invites published and aspiring adult writers to join in our inaugural summer session from July 8 to July 13, 2012. Located on the bucolic campus of Bard College at Simon&rsquo;s Rock in Great Barrington, MA, the program features five days of intensive writing workshops in fiction and memoir, with a focus on creating new work.  Under the guidance of our dedicated instructors, writers should expect one of the most productive writing weeks of their lives.</p>
<p>When not in workshop or writing, you will discover what makes the Berkshires a legendary summer retreat, and why Smithsonian Magazine recently named Great Barrington the #1 Small Town in America. With music at nearby Tanglewood, and world-class theater and dance - not to mention fantastic restaurants, swimming holes, golf courses, and antique stores - you are sure to run out of time long before you run out of enticing ways to spend it.</p>
<p>This summer, we will offer two workshops, both focused on creating new work: Fiction with Brendan Mathews, and Memoir with Alison Lobron.  Read more about the Fiction workshop <a href="./resolveUid/a14a6cf82aa2bacae0bedd2b5c8c1cfd"><span style="font-weight: bold;">here</span></a>, and the Memoir workshop <a href="./resolveUid/25322ac9165060d982003a0a6bd43b9a"><span style="font-weight: bold;">here</span></a>.  Each workshop is limited to ten students, so we encourage early registration.</p>

The Berkshire Writing Workshop is open to all, but classes are geared toward the development of short-form pieces (short stories, and essays/columns) rather than book-length works. Writers may choose to bring pieces in progress, but our primary focus is the creation of new work. We do ask that you come ready to work hard at your own writing and to give your fellow writers the gift of your careful attention and your respect.  Workshops are intended for students 21+ except by special permission.<br />

<p><a name="dayslook"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What will my days look like?</span></a><br />
Each day, we&rsquo;ll gather between 8 and 9 for a continental breakfast, and daily announcements, and then dive immediately into workshops. Classes will take place at the Liebowitz Center for International Studies, which is the newest classroom building at Simon&rsquo;s Rock. After workshop, we&rsquo;ll enjoy lunch on-site and informal conversation with either a visiting writer or a representative of the publishing industry.  <br />
<br />
Starting around 1 pm, the day is yours to enjoy, keeping in mind you will always have a writing assignment for the next day. Nature lovers may want to get outdoors in the afternoon and write at night; foodies may write by day and visit the Berkshires&rsquo; wonderful restaurants or performing arts at night. For those who wish to purchase tickets in advance: Please note we will gather for a group welcome dinner on Sunday, July 8, as well as a reading on Monday, July 9.<br />

<p><a name="facilities"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What are your facilities like?</span></a><br />
The Berkshire Writing Workshop is located at Bard College at Simon&rsquo;s Rock in the heart of the Berkshires. Known colloquially just as &ldquo;Simon&rsquo;s Rock,&rdquo; the campus is 2 miles from scenic downtown Great Barrington, which has dozens of shops and restaurants as well as a movie theater and a performing arts center.  While on campus, attendees will enjoy comfortable dorm rooms and classrooms, tasty and nutritious meals (breakfast and lunch daily, plus one dinner), and a week&rsquo;s pass to our state-of-the-art fitness center, the Kilpatrick Athletic Center.  <br />
<br />
Please note: the Simon&rsquo;s Rock campus is smoke-free. It is also quite hilly. For students who have any difficulty with mobility, we recommend you contact us before registering to make sure we can provide you with a comfortable environment. <br />
<br />
To learn more about our facility, please visit our main web site at <a href="http://www.simons-rock.edu">www.simons-rock.edu</a>.<br />
<a href="#visual-portal-wrapper" style="font-weight: bold;">^ back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="wherelive"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Where will I live?</span></a><br />
Writers from out of town will be housed in smoke-free dormitory rooms on our lovely, 275-acre campus.  All rooms are private, modern and clean, and come with basic linens, but they are not luxurious &ndash; think college dorm, not 5-star hotel.  Bathrooms are shared.  Please make us aware if you have special accessibility needs.  Please note: not all rooms are air-conditioned. For a modest fee, students may opt to guarantee an air-conditioned room; the rest will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis. <br />
<br />
Students may elect to live off-campus, but should be aware that lodging in the Berkshires is very expensive in July. You may find that a single night&rsquo;s hotel stay costs the same as a week&rsquo;s stay on campus.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> NOTICE:</span> We now have limited availability in our on-campus housing for the 2012 session. Please inquire about availability before registering.<br />
<br />
<a href="#visual-portal-wrapper" style="font-weight: bold;">^ back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="mealsincluded"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What meals are included? </span></a><br />
For residential and non-residential students alike, the workshop fee includes a delicious continental breakfast and lunch daily, as well as a welcome BBQ dinner on Sunday, July 8. If you have special dietary restrictions, please contact us before registering to make sure we can accommodate you. <br />
<br />
Given that many of the attractions of the Berkshire region take place in the afternoon and evening, we&rsquo;ve opted not to schedule dinners the other four nights to allow students maximum flexibility to pursue their own interests. We do expect informal group excursions and readings will occur. We are also happy to make restaurants suggestions &ndash; or recommend places to pick up a picnic for Tanglewood.<br />
<a href="#visual-portal-wrapper" style="font-weight: bold;">^ back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="gettingthereandaround"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What about getting there and getting around? </span></a><br />
Students are responsible for arranging their own transportation. We encourage attendees to drive as our campus is spread across 200+ hilly acres and the nearest convenience stores/amenities/restaurants are two miles away, in downtown Great Barrington. Parking is plentiful on campus and in town.  Bard College at Simon&rsquo;s Rock is a 2.5 hours&rsquo; drive from both Boston and NYC. The closest train stations, with service to NYC, are about 40 minutes away.<br />
<a href="#visual-portal-wrapper" style="font-weight: bold;">^ back to top</a></p>
<p><a style="font-weight: bold;" name="techaccess">What kind of access will I have to technology? </a><br />
Non-residential and residential students will have the use of our photocopiers to prepare for workshops, and a guest password to the campus wireless network. We encourage students to bring laptops. Those without laptops may use computers on campus, but should be aware that availability is limited.  Cell phone service is spotty throughout the Berkshires and our campus is no exception. We hope students will welcome the respite from 24/7 connectivity, and use it as a way to further their productivity. But for those who need a regular iPhone fix, fear not: We can advise you where on campus to stand in order to pick up one of the elusive signals.<br />
