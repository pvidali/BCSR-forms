Opening fall 2015.","t if …  ... there were a school that welcomed your big ideas, your imagination? That encouraged your curiosity. That didn’t try to limit it or quiet it. That respected its power, gave it room to breathe and helped you own it, shape it and develop it in a way that made sense to you.  ... your classes were taught by college professors and you loved what you were learning? And the conversation didn’t have to end when the bell rang. But continued over lunch with a professor in the dining hall, with friends in your dorm, or while rock climbing in a state-of-the-art athletic center.  What if high school only lasted two years? If after completing the 10th grade, you became a freshman at the nation’s best early college?  It does exist. We are Bard Academy at Simon’s Rock.","","we are.  Bard Academy at Simon’s Rock is the nation’s only independent school for 9th and 10th grade boarding and day students where bright, curious and motivated young people like you prep­ are to enter college two years early.  After completing 10th grade, you’ll begin full time at Bard College at Simon’s Rock, the nation’s only dedicated residential early college. The College offers the opportunity to earn your Associate of Arts degree in two years and your Bachelor of Arts degree after two more.  If you love to learn and don’t want to wait for intensive critical inquiry and advanced academic challenge, Bard Academy at Simon’s Rock may be right for you.  Why high school in two years?  At Bard Academy, we believe the traditional American high school isn’t for everyone. For too many students, junior and senior years are less about learning and more about preparing for standardized testing, filling out college applications and taking courses that look good on a résumé.  We believe that two years of concentrated study at the high school level, as opposed to the con­ventional four, is the best preparation for college. Modeled after successful day programs at the Bard High School Early Colleges in New York, Newark and Cleveland, Bard Academy provides an enriching high school experience while creating a seamless transition into college life and work, right when you are most ready for it.","","vision of a better high school.  Who better to prepare you for college than your future college professors? At Bard Academy, your courses are taught by Simon’s Rock faculty, who are not only accom­plished scholars and leaders in their fields but also experienced teachers of younger students.  The Academy capitalizes on the intellectual strengths of the College, with semin­ ar-style classes that facilitate authentic exchange between students; a curriculum that teaches clear writing as a means to and reflection of clear thinking; and opportunities for interdisci­plinary inquiry as well as sustained, independent research.
